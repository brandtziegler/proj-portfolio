# Image to HTML
In this assignment, we will work on coding the design for Continuous Good through HTML and CSS. Continuous Good is a web application that aims to solve the problem of wanting to give charitable donations to so many different causes, and not being able to decide which one(s) to donate to. The goal is to subscribe to causes and organizations, to set a monthly amount to donate, and for the website to handle the rest. Each month, you will receive an email informing you of how that month's donation will be helping people.

## Answering Tasks
For this assignment, you will be committing changes to:
- files/continuousgood/homepage.html
- files/continuousgood/style.css
- The file you are reading right now

**Please use SublimeText to edit the HTML and CSS files, as well as this file that you are reading (hw-html.md).**

**You CAN use lessons provided by the class as well as google to answer the Tasks, but all answers must be your own work**

## Committing
Your commits should always be clear, concise explanations of what is being committed. They should be granular and easy to review.

## Tasks
**Create a branch per Task, each based off of the master branch, using the following convention:**
** - [Topic]-[Assignment Number]-[Task Number]-[Your initials]**
** This means that you will create 3 branches total.**

For example, for Question/Task 1: Ashraf Abed would run the following command to create a branch based off the master branch: ```git checkout -b htmlcss-005-1-aa master```.

Upon completing a Task, **save the file, git add, and git commit your changes.**

Protip: After editing this file, you can run git status to see what files were changed and git diff [file_name] to see what exactly was changed in the file.
