# Image to HTML
In this assignment, we will work on coding the design for Continuous Good, specifically the HTML. We will work on the CSS in a future assignment. Continuous Good is a web application that aims to solve the problem of wanting to give charitable donations to so many different causes, and not being able to decide which one(s) to donate to. The goal is to subscribe to causes and organizations, to set a monthly amount to donate, and for the website to handle the rest. Each month, you will receive an email informing you of how that month's donation will be helping people.

**Please edit this file using SublimeText.**

## Answering questions
For this assignment, you will be committing changes to:
- hw_003_html.md (the file you are reading)
- continuousgood/homepage.html

**You CAN use lessons provided by the class as well as google to answer the questions, but all answers must be your own work**  

## Committing
Your commits should always be clear, concise explanations of what is being committed. They should be granular and easy to review.

## Questions
**Create a branch per question, each based off of the master branch, using the following convention:**  
** - [Topic]-[Assignment Number]-[Question Number]-[Your initials]**  

For example, for question 1: Ashraf Abed would run the following command to create a branch based off the master branch: ```git checkout -b html-003-1-aa master```.

Upon completing a question, **save the file, git add, and git commit your changes.**

Protip: After editing this file, you can run git status to see what files were changed and git diff [file_name] to see what exactly was changed in the file.

1- Explain the purpose of div and span tags in html.
*Write your answer here:*

2- Explain the difference between block-level elements and inline elements.
*Write your answer here:*

Open the continuousgood folder. It contains several files that will be necessary for working on this assignment:
- homepage.html: this is the html file you will be you modifying and committing changes from.
- continuousgood.jpg: this is the image of the continuous good homepage design that you will base your html off of.
- images: this is a folder with images you will need as you write the html (and, later, the CSS) for the homepage design.
- README.md: this file contains a breakdown of the different sections of the homepage. Use it as a guide for completing the assignment.

3- Code the continuous good homepage's HTML for the continuousgood.jpg image in the continuousgood folder. (Note: we will code the corresponding CSS in a future assignment, so it is important that you complete this assignment to the best of your ability)

## Submitting your assignment
Up until this point, you should have three branches of work, one for each question above.

### Step 1
Push the three branches to your fork of the da-assignments repository (e.g. git push [remote-name] html-003-1-aa).

### Step 2
Create a pull request for the html work ONLY (i.e. the branch for question 3).
