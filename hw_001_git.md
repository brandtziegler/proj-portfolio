# Intro to Git
In this assignment, we will learn git by using it.

## Answering questions
In this assignment, simply edit the homework file itself to answer the questions on it. Your answers will be submitted as a pull request on github.

**You CAN use lessons provided by the class as well as google to answer the questions, but all answers must be in your own words**

### To work on this assignment
1. Open the homework assignment (the file you are reading) in a text editor, such as sublime text. You should have the da-assignments repository (folder) on your computer, after cloning it during class.  

2. Using the command line (Terminal/Git bash) to create a new git branch, based off of the master branch, *for each question*. Follow the naming convention described below.

3. *After completing a question*, save the file in the text editor, then use the terminal (or git bash for windows) to add and commit the changes to the file.  

4. To start the next question, repeat step 2.

## Committing
Your commits should always be clear, concise explanations of what is being committed. They should be granular and easy to review. *For this assignment, each question should be in its own commit.*  

## Questions
**For questions 1-8 below, create a new branch based off of the master branch using the following convention:**

*[Topic]-[Assignment Number]-[Question Number]-[Your initials]*

*For example, for question 1:*
Ashraf Abed would create a branch named: ```git-001-1-aa```
