For PHP to work, you must run vagrant up successfully and place your da-assignments folder inside one of your php environments. For example, I would place my da-assignments folder inside the dev-1 folder. To see your PHP beind rendered, you would use your browser to visit the url to your php file. For example, to see the PHP output of my php file located at da-assignments/php_assignments/php_001/index.php, I would use my browser to visit dev-1.academyvm.dev/da-assignments/php_assignments/php_001/index.php.
