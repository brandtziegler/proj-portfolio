# Classwork - Image to HTML
In this classwork assignment, we will use HTML and CSS to code and style 'slices' of a homepage design.

**Please edit the file using SublimeText.**

## Answering questions
For this assignment, you will be committing changes to:
- cw_001_html/homepage.html

**You CAN use lessons provided by the class as well as google to answer the questions, but all answers must be your own work**  

## Committing
Your commits should always be clear, concise explanations of what is being committed. They should be granular and easy to review.

## Questions
**Create a branch per question, each based off of the master branch, using the following convention:**  
** - [Topic]-[Assignment Number]-[Question Number]-[Your initials]**  

For example, for question 1: Ashraf Abed would run the following command to create a branch based off the master branch: ```git checkout -b cwhtml-001-1-aa master```.

Upon completing a question, **save the file, git add, and git commit your changes.**

**You will place your HTML inside the homepage.html file and your CSS inside the style.css file. All images can be found in the images folder located inside this directory.**

Task 1: Open the full_design.jpg image and code and style the top header section **without coding the menu links**. This includes the black background, Debug Society logo on the left, and the login icon on the right.  

Task 2: Code and style the main menu. This inlcudes the 6 menu items starting with Home and ending with Contact Us. Be sure to apply a white background color and black font color whenever any of these menu items are hovered over, just as you see in the full_design.jpg image.

Task 3: Code and style the "How we're different" section. This includes the heading, the description, and the list items with the orange icons.

Task 4: Code and style the "Join the movement" section. This includes the background, the "Join the movement" text, and the "Apply today" button.

Task 5: Code and style the "Previous Graduate Statistics" section. This includes the background, the "Previous Graduate Statistics" text, and the "See statistics" button.

Task 6: Code and style the row below the footer. This includes the Copyright 2014 text and its black background.
