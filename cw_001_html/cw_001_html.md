In this classwork assignment, we will use HTML and CSS to code and style 'slices' of a homepage design.
**You will place your HTML inside the homepage.html file and your CSS inside the style.css file. All images can be found in the images folder located inside this directory.**

Task 1: Open the full_design.jpg image and code and style the top header section **without coding the menu links**. This includes the black background, Debug Society logo on the left, and the login icon on the right.  

Task 2: Code and style the main menu. This inlcudes the 6 menu items starting with Home and ending with Contact Us. Be sure to apply a white color whenever any of these menu items are hovered over, just as you see in the full_design.jpg image.

Task 3: Code and style the "Join the movement" section. This includes the background, the "Join the movement" text, and the "Apply today" button.

Task 4: Code and style the "Previous Graduate Statistics" section. This includes the background, the "Previous Graduate Statistics" text, and the "See statistics" button.
