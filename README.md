This repository contains assignments for Debug Academy's October 2015 Drupal Development class.

## Submitting assignments
We will use github pull requests to submit solutions to assignments.

Note: Be sure to use the following lessons as references for the steps listed below them:
2. ###_command_line_basics.md
3. ###_git_flow.md
1. ###_git_commands.md

Submitting a homework assignment involves a few steps:
1. Fork the repository you are currently viewing on github
3. Open the command line (git bash or the terminal)
4. Go to the debugacademy folder
  - cd ~/Desktop/DebugAcademy
2. Clone the respository locally, inside your debugacademy folder
5. Create a new branch (see git_commands.md) with the following name:
  - [Subject]-[Assignment Number]-[Your initials]
  - For example, if I were doing assignment #1 on git, I (Ashraf Abed) would create a branch named: git-1-aa
6. Complete the homework assignment
7. Commit your changes to your new branch (see git_commands.md)
8. Push your changes to your forked repository on github.com
9. Visit our forked repository on github.com
