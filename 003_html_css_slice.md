# Intro to HTML & CSS
In this assignment, we will code our first design.

## Answering questions
For this assignment, you will be committing changes to:
- 003_html_css_slice.md (the file you are reading)
- files/debugacademydotcom/homepage.html
- files/debugacademydotcom/style.css

**You CAN use lessons provided by the class as well as google to answer the questions, but all answers must be your own work**  

## Committing
Your commits should always be clear, concise explanations of what is being committed. They should be granular and easy to review.

## Questions
**Create a branch based off of the master branch using the following convention:**  
** - [Topic]-[Assignment Number]-[Question Number]-[Your initials]**  

*For example, for question 1:*  
Ashraf Abed would create a branch named: ```htmlcss-003-1-aa```

### Part 1

1- Write the HTML for the debugacademy website's header
- Place the HTML in files/debugacademydotcom/homepage.html

2- Explain the HTML you wrote for question 1.
**Write your answer to question 2 right here**

3- Write the HTML & CSS to place the logo appropriately
- The 'content' in the header (including the logo, menu, and login button) should be contained in a <div> that is 1145px wide
- The black portion of the header should have a height of 126px
- The logo should be approximately centered vertically within the header
- Please use images/da-logo.png as the logo image. You may change the width and height, but keep the width:height ratio

4- Explain how you accomplished, or tried to accomplish, question 3

5- Write the HTML & CSS for the menu in the header
- Include all the links in the image as a list
- The links' text color should be white: #ffffff
- The links' text background should be black: #000000
- The hovered links' text color should be black: #000000
- The hovered links' background color should be white: #ffffff

### Part 2

Complete the work for part 2 on a separate branch. Append '-2' to the branch name used in part 1.

6- Write the HTML & CSS for the content in between the header and the 'What are we teaching next' section.
- Note: The 'Students' and 'Employers' <div>s should be pair with their 'Apply now' and 'Hire our class' buttons. 
- You can either place those two blocks inside of the large header with the image, or after it. CSS will be used to give it the appearance of 'spilling outside'.
