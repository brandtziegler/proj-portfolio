# What is this?
This folder contains symlinks to repositories we will be working on in class.  

Symlinks can be thought of as shortcuts to other files or folders.  
We will store symlinks to our many repositories in this folder, so that individuals in the class can all access them from the same place - via symlinks in their assignments repo.  

## Creating a symlink
```ln -s [where your repo is on your computer] [an alias (filename/foldername) agreed upon in class]```
