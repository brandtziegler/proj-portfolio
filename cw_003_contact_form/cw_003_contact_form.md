# Classwork - Creating a 'Contact Us' Form
In this classwork assignment, we will use Drupal to build a Contact form that site visitors can fill out to ask us questions.

## Answering questions
For this assignment, you will be committing changes to:  
- Your proj-themes repo

**You CAN use lessons provided by the class as well as google to answer the questions, but all answers must be your own work**  

## Committing
Your commits should always be clear, concise explanations of what is being committed. They should be granular and easy to review.  

## Questions
**Complete this classwork assignment on the same branch as your first site building homework assignment:**  

### Determine the best module to create our contact form
Module needed: This will be determined during class research.

### Create the contact form on your proj-themes website
Fields needed:
- Name *
- Email *
- Phone
- I would like to.. * This should be a List (text) field with Check boxes/radio buttons. The options should include the following:
  - Hire a Graduate
  - Request a custom Theme
  - Train my Employees
  - Become a Drupal Developer!
- How did you hear about us? This field will be a select list with the following options:
  - Drupal.org
  - Search Engine
  - Recommendation
  - Drupal Meetup
  - Other

Note: All fields followed by an asterisk should be required.

### Add link to the contact form
Add a link to our contact form in the main menu.

### Bonus: Conditional field
If any option below the 'I would like to..' field is selected, *other than* the "Become a Drupal Developer!" option, a text field which asks for their company name should appear. This will require additional module(s).
