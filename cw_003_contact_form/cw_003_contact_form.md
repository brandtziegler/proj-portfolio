# Classwork - Creating a 'Contact Us' Form
In this classwork assignment, we will use Drupal to build a Contact form that site visitors can fill out to ask us questions.

Module needed: This will be determined during class research.

Fields needed:
- First Name *
- Last Name *
- Email *
- Phone
- Why are you contacing us? * This should be a List (text) field with Check boxes/radio buttons. The options should include the following:
  - Hire a Graduate
  - Request a custom Theme
  - Train Employees
  - Become a Drupal Developer!

Note: All fields followed by an asterisk should be required. Additionally, if any of the above fields are selected, with the exception of the "Become a Drupal Developer!" field, we should have a conditional field that asks for the name of their company and  position.
  
- How did you hear about us? This field will be a select list with the following options:
  - Drupal.org
  - Search Engine
  - Recommendation
  - Drupal Meetup
  - Other
  
Additionally, we will need to create a "Contact" menu link to add to the main menu.
