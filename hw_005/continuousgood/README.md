Open the continuousgood.jpg file. It is an image of the homepage design for the Continuous Good site. Looking at the design at a high-level, we can split it up into different sections. The logo and the menu together make up one section, known as the header. The section containing the main background image in this design can be referred to as the 'hero'. We'll refer to the remaining sections as Section 1, Section 2, etc, all the way down to the Footer.
