# Image to HTML and CSS
In this assignment, we will continue our work on coding the design for Continuous Good. In hw3, each student submitted an HTML-only version of the design. We will now begin coding the CSS to accompany the HTML. To ensure we all are starting from the same point, one hw3 submission was selected and can be found in the hw_004 folder at continuousgood/homepage.html.

> Continuous Good is a web application that aims to solve the problem of wanting to give charitable donations to so many different causes, and not being able to decide which one(s) to donate to. The goal is to subscribe to causes and organizations, to set a monthly amount to donate, and for the website to handle the rest. Each month, you will receive an email informing you of how that month's donation will be helping people.

## Answering questions
For this assignment, you will be committing changes to:
- hw_004_html_css_slice_contgood.md (the file you are reading)
- continuousgood/homepage.html
- continuousgood/style.css

**You CAN use lessons provided by the class as well as google to answer the questions, but all answers must be your own work**  

## Committing
Your commits should always be clear, concise explanations of what is being committed. They should be granular and easy to review.

## Questions
**Create a branch for question 2 only. It should be based off of the master branch, using the following convention:**  
** - [Topic]-[Assignment Number]-[Question Number]-[Your initials]**
