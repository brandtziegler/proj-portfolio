# Image to HTML & CSS
In this assignment, we will work on coding the designs for HA Lighting and Continuous Good.

## Answering questions
For this assignment, you will be committing changes to:
- 004_html_css_slide.md (the file you are reading)
- files/halighting/homepage.html
- files/halighting/style.css
- files/continuousgood/homepage.html
- files/continuousgood/style.css

**You CAN use lessons provided by the class as well as google to answer the questions, but all answers must be your own work**  

## Committing
Your commits should always be clear, concise explanations of what is being committed. They should be granular and easy to review.

## Questions
**Create a branch based off of the master branch using the following convention:**  
** - [Topic]-[Assignment Number]-[Website Name]-[Your initials]**  
Notice 'Website Name' rather than 'Question Number' for the branch name.

*For example, for question 1:*  
Ashraf Abed would create a branch named: ```htmlcss-004-halighting-aa```

1- Write the HTML and CSS for the HA Lighting website's header
- Place the HTML in files/halighting/homepage.html
- As always, your commit or commits should be clear, concise explanations of what is being committed. You will determine how many commits are necessary (not a trick question).

Notes for header:
- Faded 'border' around header is 11px wide
- Faded 'border' can be achieved by using a black background color or image and making it partially seethrough using opacity or transparency
- End to end width *including the border on both sides* is 1135px
- The background image for the menu in the header is menu_bg.gif
- The 'logo' HA Lighting is logo.png
- The menu links should be white (#fff)
- The *hovered* menu links should be: #ffcf4b
- The 'Call us now' text should also be: #ffcf4b
- The phone number below 'Call us now' should be: #dddddd
- The block between menu items is separator.gif
- Keep the menu font small enough to maintain the integrity of the design
- Do not spend time picking the right font, verdana or arial will suffice
- Include the slideshow image as part of the header
  - It is included as first_slide.jpg
  - The white border around the slide is 7px

2- Describe your impression of question 1 after having worked on it. Include why you felt that way as well. (ie: too hard? enjoyable?)
**Write your answer to question 2 right here**

3- Write the HTML & CSS for the section directly below the header ('WELCOME TO HA LIGHTING')
- Include at least 2 sentences of sample text below the 'WELCOME TO HA LIGHTING' header

4- Write the HTML & CSS for the section below the paragraph, with the 3 blocks
- The background image of the section is section_blue_bg.jpg
- The section is 478px tall
- The *top portion* of each block's background is saved as a 1px-wide block_top_bg.gif
- The color of the rest of the background color is white: #ffffff
- The border around each block is 9px wide
- The height of each block *not including the surrounding border* is 415px
- The header text color for each block is 0d3c6a
- Each block should be equal width
- The block section should not exceed the width of the header section
