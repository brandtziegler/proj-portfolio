# Intro to Git
In this assignment, we will learn git by using it.

## Answering questions
In this assignment, simply edit the homework file itself to answer the questions on it. Your answers will be submitted as a pull request on github.

**You CAN use lessons provided by the class as well as google to answer the questions, but all answers must be in your own words**

## Committing
Your commits should always be clear, concise explanations of what is being committed. They should be granular and easy to review.

## Questions
**Create a new branch based off of the master branch using the following convention:**
** - [Topic]-[Assignment Number]-[Question Number]-[Your initials]**

*For example, for question 1:*
Ashraf Abed would create a branch named: ```git-001-1-aa```

1- Fill in your name after this colon: 
**Commit this answer to your branch:** ```git-001-1-aa```

*For question 2:*
Ashraf Abed would create a branch named: ```git-001-2-aa```
*(Follow that pattern for all questions)*
2- Briefly explain in your own words what it means to 'pull' in git:
**Commit this answer to the branch you created for this question**

3- Briefly explain in your own words what it means to 'push' in git:
**Commit this answer to the branch you created for this question**

4- Briefly explain in your own words what it means to 'rebase' in git:
**Commit this answer to the branch you created for this question**

5- Briefly explain in your own words what it means to git 'checkout' a branch or commit:
**Commit this answer to the branch you created for this question**

6- Use git log to list your most recent commit's ID. Type at least 5 characters from the commit ID here:
**Commit this answer to the branch you created for this question**

7- Use git log to list the 2 most recent commits **before any of your own commits**. Type at least 5 characters from the two commit IDs here:
First commit ID:
Second commit ID:
**Commit this answer to the branch you created for this question**

8- Create a new branch whose history matches the master branch exactly. Use the same naming convention for the branch as you have been for previous tasks.

You don't need to create a separate branch to do items 9 and above:
9- Push all of the branches you created for your homework assignment to your forked copy of the assignments repo.

10- Create pull requests to the class' assignments repo for questions 1, 3, 5, and 6.

11- Read the lessons on git commands and git flow. You are not expected to memorize this information, google will always be available. But any top employer will expect you to have a solid understanding of the basics.
