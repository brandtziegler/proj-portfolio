# Image to HTML
In this assignment, we will work on coding the design for Continuous Good using HTML and CSS.  

## Answering Tasks
For this assignment, you will be committing changes to:  
- files/continuousgood/homepage.html  
- files/continuousgood/style.css  

**Please use SublimeText to edit the HTML and CSS files.**  

## Committing
Your commits should always be clear, concise explanations of what is being committed. They should be granular and easy to review.

## Tasks
**Create a branch based off of the master branch, using the following convention:**
** - [Topic]-[Assignment Number]-[Your initials]**  

For example, Ashraf Abed would run the following command to create a branch based off the master branch: ```git checkout -b htmlcss-hw-8-aa master```.  

Upon completing a section, **save the file, git add, and git commit your changes.**

Protip: After editing this file, you can run git status to see what files were changed and git diff [file_name] to see what exactly was changed in the file.

Open the continuousgood folder. It can be found in files/continuousgood. It contains several files that will be necessary for working on this assignment:
- **homepage.html**: this is the HTML file you will be modifying and adding HTML code to. We have outlined where your code should be written for each section within the file by using HTML comments. You will replace the comment (the <!-- [text] -->) with your HTML for that section.
- **style.css**: this is the CSS file you will me modifying and adding CSS code to.
- **continuousgood.jpg**: this is the image of the continuous good homepage design that we are coding.
- **images**: this is a folder with images you will need as you write the html and CSS for the homepage design.

Task 1 - Code the "Testimonials" section based on the continuousgood.jpg image in the continuousgood folder. This is the section that shows the images and remarks of 3 users.
- First code the HTML in the file homepage.html
- Then code the CSS in the file style.css
- This should be an unordered list of testimonials
- Use any images you'd like for the portraits

**Upon completion of Task 1, save the file, git add, and git commit your work.**
