# Image to HTML & CSS
In this assignment, we will work on coding the design for Continuous Good.

## Answering questions
For this assignment, you will be committing changes to:
- 005_html_css_slice_contgood.md (the file you are reading)
- files/continuousgood/homepage.html
- files/continuousgood/style.css

**You CAN use lessons provided by the class as well as google to answer the questions, but all answers must be your own work**  

## Committing
Your commits should always be clear, concise explanations of what is being committed. They should be granular and easy to review.

## Questions
**Create a branch per question, each based off of the master branch, using the following convention:**  
** - [Topic]-[Assignment Number]-[Question Number]-[Your initials]**  

Ashraf Abed would create a branch named: ```htmlcss-005-1-aa```

1- Explain two CSS techniques that can be used for centering a div.  
*Write your answer here*  

2- Join a team of 3 people to code the entire homepage for continuous good.  
**Enter the names of the people on your team here:**
- Name
- Name
- Name

3- Code the continuous good homepage's HTML and CSS to match the image.  
Each team member must have at least one **substantial** commit for this question to their name.  

For example:  
- Person 1 creates a commit with the header's HTML and CSS.
- Person 2 creates a commit with a section of the page's HTML and CSS.
- Person 3 creates a commit with the footer's HTML and CSS.
Then, any one person may 'drive', or do the rest of the committing, after this point.  

**The branches for each individual must match one another exactly at submission time.**  
This means that every individual will have to push their work to github, and every individual will have to pull others' work from github.
